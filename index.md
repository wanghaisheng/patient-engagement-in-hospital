An important focus for meaningful use criteria is to engage patients in their care by allowing them online access to their health information, including test results. There has been little evaluation of such initiatives. Using a mixed methods analysis of electronic health record data, surveys, and qualitative interviews, we examined the impact of allowing patients to view their test results via patient portal in one large health system. Quantitative data were collected for new users and all users of the patient portal. Qualitative interviews occurred with patients who had received an HbA1c or abnormal Pap result. Survey participants were active patient portal users. Our main measures were patient portal usage, factors associated with viewing test results and utilizing care, and patient and provider experiences with patient portal and direct release. Usage data show 80% of all patient portal users viewed test results during the year. Of survey respondents, 82.7% noted test results to be a very useful feature and 70% agreed that patient portal has made their provider more accessible to them. Interviewed patients reported feeling they should have direct access to test results and identified the ability to monitor results over time and prepare prior to communicating with a provider as benefits. In interviews, both patients and physicians reported instances of test results leading to unnecessary patient anxiety. Both groups noted the benefits of results released with provider interpretation. Quantitative data showed patient utilization to increase with viewing test results online, but this effect is mitigated when results are manually released by physicians. Our findings demonstrate that patient portal access to test results was highly valued by patients and appeared to increase patient engagement. However, it may lead to patient anxiety and increase rates of patient visits. We discuss how such unintended consequences can be addressed and larger implications for meaningful use criteria.

Decreasing Laboratory Turnaround Time and Patient Wait Time by Implementing Process Improvement Methodologies in an Outpatient Oncology Infusion Unit



Streamlining workflows and placing a phlebotomy station inside of the Comprehensive Treatment Unit (CTU) decreased laboratory turnaround times by 53% for patients who required same-day laboratory and CTU services.

Purpose:
Prolonged patient wait times in the outpatient oncology infusion unit indicated a need to streamline phlebotomy processes by using existing resources to decrease laboratory turnaround time and improve patient wait time.

Methods:
Using the DMAIC (define, measure, analyze, improve, control) method, a project to streamline phlebotomy processes within the outpatient oncology infusion unit in an academic Comprehensive Cancer Center known as the Comprehensive Treatment Unit (CTU) was completed. Laboratory turnaround time for patients who needed same-day lab and CTU services and wait time for all CTU patients was tracked for 9 weeks.

Results:
During the pilot, the wait time from arrival to CTU to sitting in treatment area decreased by 17% for all patients treated in the CTU during the pilot. A total of 528 patients were seen at the CTU phlebotomy location, representing 16% of the total patients who received treatment in the CTU, with a mean turnaround time of 24 minutes compared with a baseline turnaround time of 51 minutes.

Conclusions:
Streamlining workflows and placing a phlebotomy station inside of the CTU decreased laboratory turnaround times by 53% for patients requiring same day lab and CTU services. The success of the pilot project prompted the team to make the station a permanent fixture.

Introduction: This study assessed patient preferences and physician practices for laboratory test results notification in ambulatory care.

Methods: Patients aged 18 years or older (n = 728) who were scheduled to see their primary care physician at 5 clinics were offered the opportunity to participate in an anonymous survey during their clinic visit. Their primary care physicians were also invited to participate in a separate online survey. Questions on both surveys included the current method of laboratory test results notification and satisfaction with the method.

Results: The majority of patients reported satisfaction with the current method of notification of normal results—the US mail—which was also the preferred method for notification of normal test results by both patients and physicians. Direct phone contact by the physician was the preferred method for notification of abnormal results by both patients (64%) and physicians (41%). Patients’ preferred method of notification of normal results significantly agreed with the current method (P < .0001), whereas that of abnormal results did not (P = .52).

Conclusions: Our findings indicate that patients and physicians both prefer the US mail for notification of normal laboratory test results and a direct phone call by the physician for notification of abnormal results.

Effective patient-physician communication is the backbone of primary health care delivery.1–4 Its success depends on effective communication, notification of any relevant laboratory test results, and appropriate timely intervention resulting from it.5,6 The Institute of Medicine report “Crossing the Quality Chasm” suggested that enhancing the flow of information between patients and medical providers would help to reduce errors and improve quality.7 In addition, prompt communication of test results may help patients with their decision making.8

Communication to the patient of laboratory test results is a well-focused but less addressed issue. Lack of proper communication has led to ineffective health care delivery and patient dissatisfaction, which can potentially lead to malpractice litigation. The results of laboratory tests are often not communicated to patients because most physicians take a “no news is good news” approach to patient notification of laboratory test results.9 Moreover, Boohaker et al10 demonstrated that one third of physicians did not always notify patients of abnormal test results, whereas most patients (>90%) wanted to be notified of all test results.9,11 This failure often results in the deterioration of patients’ health and may lead to medical errors, as reported in a study of bone densitometry.6 This sequence of events has been highlighted through research about medical errors.12 A vast body of literature indicates that most patients want to be notified of all their test results, whether normal or abnormal.9–11,13

Although the importance of the notification of laboratory test results for efficient patient care has been emphasized over the past several decades,1 no satisfactory method has been developed. A few studies have suggested that providing patients access to their medical records is an effective way to communicate test results.3,4,14 Most studies have concluded that patients generally prefer notification by mail.5,6,10,12,15 Mailing the results with an explanation of abnormal results has been reported as one solution.13 Reporting over the phone has been cited as a preferred method by a few studies.11 Some also emphasized that patients should discuss their preferences for laboratory test result notification with their providers.11,13 Notification during the follow-up appointment was also suggested in some studies.13

In the current study, we focused on patient and physician attitudes toward laboratory test results notification in ambulatory care. The issues addressed in this study were (1) the degree to which patients are notified of their laboratory test results; (2) methods that patients prefer for this purpose; (3) patient satisfaction with the current methods of notification; and (4) methods that physicians prefer to use to notify their patients of laboratory test results.

The inclusion of physician preferences, in particular, is a major contribution of this study to our current knowledge. Results of this study may assist with strategies to match physician methods of laboratory test results notification with patient preference. Finding a common method for the notification of laboratory test results that is acceptable to both providers and patients may lead to improved care, better patient satisfaction, and decreased risk of malpractice litigation.

Patient Preferences and Physician Practices for Laboratory Test Results Notification

Patient Preferences for and Satisfaction with Methods of Communicating Test Results in a Primary Care Practice

Background
Appropriate and timely communication of test results is an important element of high-quality health care. Patients’ preferences regarding and satisfaction with test result notification methods in a primary care practice were evaluated.

Methods
Some 1,458 consecutive patients were surveyed for whom routine blood tests were performed in the primary care internal medicine division at the Mayo Clinic Rochester (Minnesota) between January and March 2006.

Results
Among 888 respondents, test result notification occurred by telephone call (43%), return visit (35%), letter (3%), e-mail (0.1%), or a combination of methods (19%). Most (60%) telephone calls were handled by nurses. Patient preferences for notification method were telephone call (55%), return visit (20%), letter (19%), e-mail (5%), and automated answering mechanism (1%). Among patients reporting preference for telephone call, 67% wanted a call from a physician or nurse practitioner. Overall, 44% of patients received results by their preferred method; patients who did not were more likely to be dissatisfied with the communication method than those who did (10% vs. 5%, p = 0.01). A majority of patients were at least somewhat anxious to learn their test results, and patients greatly valued timeliness in test-result notification.

Discussion
The results describe primary care patients’ preferences for communication from their providers. Disparities exist between current practice and patient preferences in this important care delivery process. A telephone call from a physician or nurse practitioner was used to deliver test results for fewer than half of the patients who preferred to receive their results by this method. Future work should explore reimbursement of patient-preferred options and assess ways to improve resource-conscious test result communication methods.

Patients' Preferences for Receiving Laboratory Test Results

Objectives: The laboratory, as a diagnostic department in the hospital, plays an important role in the treatment and prevention of diseases. Paying attention to patients’ preferences for communication of test results may provide a better and more responsive system for delivering these results. This study aimed to identify patient preferences regarding receiving their laboratory test results electronically and to identify the reasons behind their choice.

Study Design: Descriptive-analytical study.

Methods: This study was carried out in 2015 with 200 patients who had access to the internet and had been referred at least once previously to the hospital laboratory department to receive their test results. Data were collected through an expert-validated questionnaire, and its reliability was confirmed by test–retest (P = .8). Data were analyzed using χ2 and marginal independence SPSS and R software.

Results: Ninety-eight percent of participants preferred to be notified by short message service when their test results were ready. All participants preferred to receive their test results online, and 82.5% (n = 165) preferred to receive both normal and abnormal test results this way. The main reason for receiving results online was time savings, which was reported by 77% of participants, followed by lowering the chance of missing the results (31%). About 40% of participants thought e-mail notification was more secure than accessing the results through a hospital website.

Conclusions: Findings showed that although patients wanted to benefit from online services for receiving their test results, they were concerned about confidentiality and security. Before using online technologies, security measures necessary to protect patient privacy and to gain the trust of patients should be defined.

Beyond the Lab: The Link between Health IT and Laboratory Test Problems

http://patientsafety.pa.gov/ADVISORIES/Pages/201810_HealthITandLaboratory.aspx

Laboratory testing plays an important role in the diagnostic process; thus, timely and accurate laboratory testing processes are essential to delivering safe patient care. Health information technology (health IT) has been introduced as a mechanism to reduce error and improve efficiency throughout the laboratory testing process. Yet, health IT was indicated as a contributing factor to laboratory-test problems in 775 evaluable events reported January 2016 through December 2017 through the Pennsylvania Patient Safety Reporting System. The pre-pre analytical phase, involving test ordering, drawing, and transportation to the laboratory, accounted for the largest number of events. Problems due to incorrect human data entry (i.e., wrong input) and incorrect machine output or display of data (i.e., output/display error) were most common. Risk reduction strategies include assembling a multidisciplinary team to evaluate and improve the total testing process, simplifying test names in order menus, monitoring the display of results, and establishing a communication plan for incomplete specimens, canceled specimens, and amended results.

Is the practice of delivering medical test results online through portals the best way to engage patients?



https://medcitynews.com/2018/03/delivering-medical-test-results-online-through-portals/
That means that a patient may be the first to learn of a suspicious breast mass, a recurrence of cancer or possible kidney failure. At Johns Hopkins medical system in Baltimore, for example, results of a PSA test to screen for prostate cancer come with this disclaimer: “While Johns Hopkins providers check results frequently, you may see results before your provider has seen them.”

Breast cancer specialist Lidia Schapira is an associate professor at the Stanford University Medical Center and editor-in-chief of Cancer.net, the patient information website of the American Society of Clinical Oncology. While she regards online access as beneficial, “the danger is that the patient may learn information they’re unprepared to receive and may feel abandoned if they can’t reach their doctor.”
 

 A recent study by Singh and his colleagues found that, like Devitt, nearly two-thirds of 95 patients who obtained test results via a portal received no explanatory information about the findings. As a result, nearly half conducted online searches. Many with abnormal results called their doctors.


That echoes a 2016 study led by researchers from the University of Pittsburgh. These scientists found that in addition to engaging patients, portal use may increase anxiety and lead to more doctor visits.

设置延时是很重要的
A year or so ago, Geisinger Health System in Pennsylvania began making most test results — but not biopsies or HIV screening — available to patients within four hours of being finalized.

“We essentially release results twice a day seven days a week with a four-hour lag,” said Ben Hohmuth, Geisinger’s associate chief medical informatics officer. The delay, he said, gives doctors time to review results. Patients who log on over a weekend can contact an on-call physician if they can’t reach their own doctor. The goal of rapid release, Hohmuth said, is to “be patient-centered and transparent.”

在我的观点中，医院管理系统的核心是HIS，CIS，HRP三大块，医疗crm狭义理解的话应划分在his的预约排班，随访反馈等部分。您文中所提到的crm功能概念有所泛化，有些覆盖了PACS,LIS系统的功能，有些涵盖了HIS与CIS部分功能。同时在您的图中也并没有看到医院关于“人，财，物”的管理架构。所以我的观点是，用泛化概念的crm来作为核心基础架构，无论是对管理还是业务操作都会在实际情况中带来一些不足，尤其是一些较大的公立医院。当然您的观点是值得借鉴与思考的。

CRM（Customer Relationship Management,客户关系管理）是利用信息科学技术，实现市场营销、销售、服务等活动的自动化，使企业能更高效地为客户提供满意、周到的服务，是以提高客户满意度、忠诚度为目的的一种管理经营方式。


特别是在医疗市场竞争不断加剧的情况下，对于各级各类尤其是民营医疗机构，如何通过合理高效的前瞻性客户关系管理实践，提高患者满意度，从而形成客户忠诚度和美誉度，显然是取得竞争优势的关键所在。笔者认为，这也应该是互联网医疗或移动医疗创业者们，最应该关注的创业“风口”。想想看，又有谁会拒绝帮自己带来客户和赚钱的人呢？

在CRM的范畴内，首先完整记录患者基本信息和就诊信息，再进行信息的分类与整理，这样既可以结合海量信息对市场进行一定的分析与预测，同时还能以此为基础，对患者进行有效的诊后跟踪回访，主动把握患者进一步需求，通过提供个性化服务等，提高患者满意度。所以，如果能以健康档案为核心，以数据库营销为手段，进行全面的CRM体系建设和个性化服务管理，一定会收到最好的效果。

HIS其实就是一种典型的工具性应用，但是对于医院管理和运行效率的提升至关重要。HIS系统可以关联客户关系管理平台，包括医院呼叫中心、医院短信平台、患者关系业务管理系统等子系统。
